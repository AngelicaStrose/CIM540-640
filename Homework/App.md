# My super awesome app

StyleMe is an application that essentially takes the hassle out of choosing your outfit, shoes, makeup, etcetera, for an event. Why try and spend hours in the closet finding the perfect look when we can choose it for you (based on highly specific surveys and algorithms)? The user will have the opportunity to scroll through a plethora of different looks, narrowed down based off of user input, complete with every aspect of a full attire, and then the stylist will come to you (all clothing, makeup, etcetera provided) to get you ready for that special event!
