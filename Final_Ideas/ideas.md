\\FRIDAY NIGHT  

MAIN PREMISE: This App is meant to be used as a tool for indecisive couples who have no idea what restaurant/activity they want to do on a Friday Night (or any date night, for that matter!)

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION: The app would use a randomized algorithm to choose an activity, and then pair it with a restaurant. The user is able to reroll, but is only limited to one reroll per 24-hour period.

\\DRAWFUL
Created by JackBox games, and is the main inspiration for my final project.

MAIN PREMISE: A game that challenges players to draw their own ridiculous images based on a prompt given to them. Sort of like charades.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION: From website-"Drawful 2 increases the overall number of totally new prompts by 50%, adds bonus score streaks for consecutive correct answers, and adds the ability to paint with two colors instead of one, making it easy to fit even greater creativity and detail in every sketch. Thereâ€™s even a new option for players to tweet out GIFs of their favorite drawings, so everyone on Twitter can share the fun (and shame) of your last game."

HOW IT APPLIES TO MY PROJECT: The concept is essentially the same. A player will be given a prompt and asked to draw an image to the best of their ability based on that prompt. Players will than vote on how accurate the image is.

\\STYLEME

PREMISE: This was an expansion on my first homework assignment, detailing an app that would act as a Uber for the fashion world, pairing users up with self-proclaimed stylists that would then come to their home and dress them up for any event. Obviously I wouldn't be able to include the actual functional aspect, but I wanted to develop the interface.
