TICK Game

TICK is a trivia game, testing the users' ability to answer questions of varying difficulty in 30 seconds or less. See how much you score across the four categories and compare your scores with others!

Users would input their answers to a plethora of questions, and get an output of the correct answer, as well as an increase of 10 pts to their score.

TICK is tailored to 14+ users.

Basic Instructions:

Choose a genre (there's Math, English, Popular Culture and Random Knowledge(sort of like a wildcard round)), and answer questions based on that genre.
