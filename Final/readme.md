Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?

* This product, in my opinion, is the perfect boredom tool. Whenever I am in a class that I'm simply not interested
in or doesn't catch my at attention, I need a suitable distraction. This app is perfect for that, mimicking the 
functionality of MS paint so that the user can scribble around and come up with any drawing they want without
the burdon of bringing up an actual paint tool (which isn't even offered on Macs). 

What are your inputs?

* The inputs are essentially mouse clicks to the variety of colors on the palette. 

What are your outputs?

* The outputs are user-generated strokes to the canvas. 

Who is the target audience for your project?

* Procrastinators. 

Where will your project be displayed?

* Via a local server.
